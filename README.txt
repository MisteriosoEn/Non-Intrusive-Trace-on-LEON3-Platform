# UCInspire_Project
This repository will contain several versions of LEON3 microprocessor platform
The platform is realized on Digilent Nexys-Video FPGA board using design tool Xilinx Vivado 2017.2, Vivado 2017.3 and Vivado 2018.2
Some code were supported in Vivado 2017.2 but not supported in the later versions of Vivado (the design tool will report a syntax error), but it just needs some simple changes to adapt to them.
